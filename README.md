# Welcome to My Cloud Resume Challenge Project!

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge project repository! In this README, I'll provide an overview of my project, its purpose, and how to navigate through it.

## Introduction

My name is Aliyah, and this repository hosts my Cloud Resume Challenge project. The Cloud Resume Challenge is an initiative to help aspiring cloud engineers showcase their skills by creating a personal website and deploying it to the cloud.

## About the Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in various cloud technologies and services. Through this project, I aim to:

- Build a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Deploy the website to a cloud service provider. I used AWS to get knowledge in the differnt services. I used S3, CloudFront, Lambda, and DynamoDB. 
- Implement serverless architecture for dynamic content using services like AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- Showcase my skills in infrastructure as code using tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment using GitHub Actions
- And more!

## Project Structure

- **/src**: This directory contains the source code for my personal website. It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other assets used to build the website.
- **/infrastructure**: Here, I store the infrastructure as code (IaC) templates used to provision cloud resources needed for hosting the website. This may include AWS CloudFormation templates, Terraform configurations, or other IaC scripts.
- **/scripts**: This directory contains any scripts or automation tools used in the project, such as deployment scripts or setup utilities.
- **/docs**: If applicable, this directory may contain documentation related to the project, including usage guides, architecture diagrams, or other relevant materials.
